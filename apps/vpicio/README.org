* VPICIO - GekkoFS benchmarks

** How to run
The job runs via executing the =job.sh= script on the first note of a slurm job.
Different parameters like the file system to use can be adjusted within the *parameter* section of the =job.sh= script.


1. Build and install GekkoFS following the official instructions.
2. Setup vpicio.
3. Adjust hardcoded paths within =job.sh= to your environment.
4. Adjust the experiment parameters within =job.sh= to your liking.
5. ssh into the first note of your reservation and execute the =job.sh= script.

For convenience, a single job running =job.sh= can be scheduled via =shedule_and_observe_single_job.sh=.
