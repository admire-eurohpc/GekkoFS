* Quantum Espresso - GekkoFS benchmarks

** How to run
The job runs via executing the =job.sh= script on the first note of a slurm job.
Different parameters like the file system to use can be adjusted within the *parameter* section of the =job.sh= script.


1. Build and install GekkoFS following the official instructions.
2. Build Quantum Espresso following the official instructions.
3. Adjust Quantum Espresso's =environment_variables= file:

   #+begin_src
-TMP_DIR=$PREFIX/tempdir
+TMP_DIR=$QUES_TMP_DIR

-PARA_PREFIX=" "
+PARA_PREFIX="$QUES_MPI_CMD"

-PARA_IMAGE_PREFIX="mpirun -np 4"
+PARA_IMAGE_PREFIX="mpirun -np $(( NODE_NUMBER*16*2 ))"
   #+end_src

4. Adjust hardcoded paths within =job.sh= to your environment.
5. Adjust the experiment parameters within =job.sh= to your liking.
6. ssh into the first note of your reservation and execute the =job.sh= script.

For convenience, a single job running =job.sh= can be scheduled via =shedule_and_observe_single_job.sh=.
